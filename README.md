# Saving the World (Post A-level Edition)

Good morning boys and girls,

It is the time of the year that I usually (start to) receive requests for university admissions/scholarships/etc. recommendations. Please read and understand this document before you reach out.

This guide is to help you help yourselves so that you significantly improve the chances of getting what you want, and hopefully the world becomes a better place because of this. ðŸ™‚

For a general AI-generated guide, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HKPOb2f39jEE7oV1mBEwf80ATzMNYOZ3AdbpFfQ1HkI). This guide is Gi-generated and focuses on the concrete/specific things that you can actually do, if you have not already started.

Some/most of these have been somewhat designed into the Computing@ASR 2023-24 curriculum. So if you have already done (some of) these, good for you and please continue to save the world.

## Important Note

Oftentimes, (most) students only do short-term/ad hoc things that can help them in exams/testimonials. What really shows that you are truly passionate about something is actually what you have done that are not for assignments/exams and not only during your course of study, but especially AFTER that.

**The first question that I will typically ask: What have you done after A-levels?**

## Minimal Baselines

The following are the minimal baselines that students ought to have done:

### Professional Presence

You should have updated LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, listing your aspirations/achievements and contribution history/pattern on issues and projects that you truly care about. The former helps you grow and notify your professional network, while the latter showcases your ability/willingness to serve and practical proficiencies which others can be empowered to adapt for positive change. Keeping things updated shows sustained discipline.

If you prefer to express yourself more creatively, go establish a discoverable digital identity/presence eg [https://aicomputing.sg](https://aicomputing.sg)

### Community Involvement

Get involved with the community. You can start by attending tech meetups:
- [Junior Developers Singapore](https://www.meetup.com/junior-developers-singapore)
- [Gen-C Events](https://gen-c.info/events.html)

Participate in hackathons such as:
- [NUS Hack n Roll](https://hacknroll.nushackers.org)
- [Hackomania](https://hackomania.geekshacking.com)

Or start something new altogether. It is one thing to excel by oneself, it is an even better and more rewarding experience to collaborate with fellow humans for greater impact beyond self.

Some are currently helping to organise [PyConSG25](https://pycon.sg/team.html). How about you?

### Communication

Lastly, you should/must communicate what you have done/are doing, because no one can read your mind unless they know you well, and most people in this world can't/don't. Very often, being able and willing to share your views (even if you disagree) proactively and constructively can lead to better team outcomes and shows you are not merely a reactive/passive follower. The ability to articulate your thinking and reasoning affirms you really care about the ongoing process (not only the end product) and for others.

## The AI Era

We are living in an amazing AI-bombarded era. Having meaningful interactions with humans online/offline is becoming a daily necessity to distinguish yourself from a sea of automated agents.

## Final Words

Your grades are already cast in stone the moment you step out of the exam venue after your papers, so no one or nothing we can do can alter history. Your success in life is not determined by your grades but by what you start and continue to do looking forward.

Congratulations. You actually are capable of writing your own testimonial/recommendation and leave me in peaceful retyrement. I thank you very much for this. :)
